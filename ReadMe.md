The idea of the application was that using the Google Maps API, a game similar to that of
frisbee could be created. The user could join/create a game that would be shown on the map to
other local users and would be assigned the role of a “catcher”. As a catcher, you will receive a
destination area, that has been chosen by the thrower, where you will have to move in a limited
time. Doing so will result in advancing to the next round where the role of a “catcher” would
switch with the role of a “thrower” (and vice versa) over and over until one of the users fails to
“catch” the destination point in time. This would therefore provide an interactive and fun way
of doing fitness while also encouraging a social lifestyle by introducing the user to new players
in public lobbies.

Core features:
1) Register an account
a) Create an account using email, username, and password which would be stored in
the online database
2) Log into the account
a) Using Email / Username and Password, the user would be allowed to log into their
account provided that this has been registered beforehand
b) These details will also be saved to create a session so that the user doesn’t need to
log in on the same device after they have logged once
3) On a map screen, all local games should be displayed
a) The local database would also be populated only with the games around the user
4) Join a game on the map screen
a) By tapping any of the games on the map, the user should be able to join and start
playing
3
5) Display other players in the same game as them on the map
a) The user and those players would also have their positions refreshed every pre-set
interval to ensure an accurate representation
6) Interact within the game
a) The user should be able to throw/catch the frisbee depending on their current status
7) Destination of the frisbee should be displayed on the map
